# Introduction To HTML And Javascript

This is the first project based course in the Microsoft Professional Program for Front-End Web Development track. Full description of the course can be found [here](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-html-javascript-microsoft-dev211-1x-3) .

## Objective

To learn the essential skills for creating an interactive web application using HTML5, JavaScript.

## Getting Started

All code have been carefully written with simplicity and clarity in mind. Yet, some intermediate or expert programmers may find some novelty in the coding convention which may seem too unnecessarily ambiguous or boring. It's OK, I'm still a beginner at the time of taking this course and your feedback will greatly be appreciated.

The project is carefully structured within the [contoso_news](https://github.com/ALCwithMicrosoft/Intro-to-HTML-and-Javascript/tree/master/contoso_news) directory.
